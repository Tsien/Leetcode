#### Problem Link:[Implement strStr() ](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-strstr/) 

#### Solution 1 Brute force

##### Idea:

The brute force method is straightforward to implement. We scan the needle with the haystack from its first position and start matching all subsequent letters one by one. If one of the letters does not match, we start over again with the next position in the haystack.

The key is to implement the solution cleanly without dealing with each edge case separately.

Note, try Rabin-Karp algorithm, KMP algorithm, and the Boyer- Moore algorithm.
   
##### Time Complexity:

O(n * m), n = length of haystack, m = length of needle

##### Space Complexity:

O(1)

##### Source code:
{% highlight C++ %}

class Solution {
public:
    int strStr(string haystack, string needle) {
        int n = haystack.length(), m = needle.length();
        if (!m) return 0;
        for (int i = 0; i <= n - m; i++)
            if (haystack[i] == needle[0]){
                int j = 1;
                while (j < m && haystack[i + j] == needle[j]){j++;}
                if (j >= m) return i;
            }
        return -1;
    }
};
