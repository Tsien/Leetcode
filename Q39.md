        vector<int> cur;
        vector<vector<int> > combinationSum(vector<int> &candidates, int target) {

            else if (target >= *b){
                cur.push_back(*b);
                findT(b, e, target - *b);
                cur.pop_back();
                findT(b + 1, e, target);
            }
        }
    };

```

#### Attention:

Both above solutions are accepted on Leetcode OJ. However, I think both of them omit to eliminate duplicate cases. For example, if C = [2, 2, 4] and T = 6, the correct answer should be [2, 2, 2] and [2, 4]. However, if you run the above code in Xcode or VS, you will get [2, 2, 2] X 4 and [2, 4] X 2. Thus, the problem should assume that there is no duplicates in set C.
