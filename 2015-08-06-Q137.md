#### Problem Link:[Single Number II ](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/) 

#### Solution 1 

##### Idea:

Since every element appears three times except for one, the number of '1' at every position of 32 bits must be multiples of 3. If not, it must be the single number that break the rule.  

##### Time Complexity:

O(n)

##### Space Complexity:

O(1)

##### Source code:
{% highlight C++ %}

class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 31; i >= 0; i--){
            int no = 0, tmp = 1 << i;
            for (auto j : nums)
                if (j & tmp)
                    no++;
            if (no % 3)
                ans |= tmp;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
