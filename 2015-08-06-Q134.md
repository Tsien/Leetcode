#### Problem Link:[Gas Station ](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/) 

#### Solution 1 Iterative 

##### Idea:

If we can start from the ith gas station and reach the jth gas station, but cannot reach the (j+1)th gas station. Then, we can conclude that the gas stations between ith and (j - 1)th gas station cannot reach (j+1)th gas station. So, in the next search, we start from the jth gas station.  


##### Time Complexity:

O(n)

##### Space Complexity:

O(1)

##### Source code:
{% highlight C++ %}

class Solution {
public:
    int canCompleteCircuit(vector<int>& gas, vector<int>& cost) {
        int n = gas.size(), tmp, i = 0, cur = 0, j;
        while (i < n){
            tmp = gas[i] - cost[i];
            if (tmp >= 0){
                cur = tmp, j = (i + 1) % n;
                while (cur >= 0 && j != i){
                    cur += gas[j] - cost[j];
                    j = (j + 1) % n;
                }
                if (cur >= 0) return i;
                i = j - 1 > i ? j - 1 : n;
            }
            else
                i++;
        }
        return -1;
    }
