#### Problem Link:[House Robber II ](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-ii/) 

#### Solution 1 DP

##### Idea:

Since all houses are arranged in a circle,  we have to choose one of the first and last houses or neither of them. Because if we choose both of them, it will alert the police.   

Thus, we can do two passes. The first one ignore the first house and the second one ignores the last house. And the situation of choosing neither of them is already included. 

  
##### Time Complexity:

O(n)

##### Space Complexity:

O(1)

##### Source code:
{% highlight C++ %}

class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        int ans1, ans2, pre = 0, ppre = 0, n = nums.size();
        if (0 == n){
            return 0;
        }
        if (1 == n){
            return nums[0];
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++){//ignore the first house
            ans1 = max(nums[i] + ppre, pre);
            ppre = pre;
            pre = ans1;
        }
        pre = ppre = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++){//ignore the last house
            ans2 = max(nums[i] + ppre, pre);
            ppre = pre;
            pre = ans2;
        }
        return max(ans1, ans2);
    }
};
