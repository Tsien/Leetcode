#### Problem Link:[Majority Element II ](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element-ii/) 

#### Solution 1 Moore voting 

##### Idea:

Check Q169.

First, regardless of the number of n, there are two majority elements at most.

Then, we can use Moore voting to find these two elements. This is round 1.

Finally, check their frequency of occurrence in the array. This is round 2.

About Moore Voting:

>The essential concepts is you keep a counter for the majority number X. If you find a number Y that is not X, the current counter should deduce 1. The reason is that if there is 5 X and 4 Y, there would be one (5-4) more X than Y. This could be explained as "4 X being paired out by 4 Y".

About this problem: 

> consider 3 cases: 
> 
> 1. there are no elements that appears more than n/3 times, then whatever the algorithm got from 1st round wound be rejected in the second round. 
> 2. there are only one elements that appears more than n/3 times, after 1st round one of the candicate must be that appears more than n/3 times(<2n/3 other elements could only pair out for <n/3 times), the other candicate is not necessarily be the second most frequent but it would be rejected in 2nd round. 
> 3. there are two elments appears more than n/3 times, candicates would contain both of them. (<n/3 other elements couldn't pair out any of the majorities.)

##### Time Complexity:

O(n)

##### Space Complexity:

        vector<int> ans;
        if (a.second > n)
            ans.push_back(a.first);
        if (b.second > n)
            ans.push_back(b.first);
