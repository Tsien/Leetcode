### Problem Link:[Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/) 

>Follow up for "Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array":

>What if duplicates are allowed?

>Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?


### Solution 1 A lazy method

#### Idea:

Same as Q153. 

Duplicates do not affect complexity.

#### Time Complexity:
O(n)

#### Space Complexity:
O(1)

#### Source code:
{% highlight C++ %}

class Solution {
public:
    int findMin(vector<int> &num) {
        for (int i = 1; i < num.size(); i++){
            if (num[i] < num[i - 1])
                return num[i];
        }
        return num[0];
    }
};

{% endhighlight %}

### Solution 2 Binary Search

#### Idea:

Similar to Q33 and Q 81.

However, due to duplicates, things become a little complicated.

    If nums[mid] == nums[tail], we cannot decide whether the Minimum is in [head, mid] or [mid, tail]. So, we have to deal with both possible cases.

Take care of these test cases:

    Input:	[3,3,1]
    Input:	[10,1,10,10,10]


#### Time Complexity:

O(n)

#### Space Complexity:

O(1)

#### Source code:

{% highlight C++ %}

class Solution {
public:
    int findMin(vector<int>& nums) {
        int head, tail, mid;
        head = 0;
        tail = (int)nums.size() - 1;
        while (head < tail){
            mid = head + (tail - head) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] > nums[tail])
                head = mid + 1;
            else if (nums[mid] < nums[tail])
                tail = mid;
            else {//this situation is complicated. [3,3,1] or [10,1,10,10,10]
                vector<int> former(nums.begin() + head, nums.begin() + mid + 1);
                vector<int> latter(nums.begin() + mid + 1, nums.begin() + tail + 1);
                return min(findMin(former), findMin(latter));
            }
        }
        return nums[head];
    }
};

{% endhighlight %}


_A conciser version:_


{% highlight C++ %}

class Solution {
public:
    int findMin(vector<int> &num) {
        int lo = 0;
        int hi = num.size() - 1;
        int mid = 0;

        while(lo < hi) {
            mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;

            if (num[mid] > num[hi]) {
                lo = mid + 1;
            }
            else if (num[mid] < num[hi]) {
                hi = mid;
            }
            else { // when num[mid] and num[hi] are same
                hi--;
            }
        }
        return num[lo];
    }
};

{% endhighlight %}

#### Bonus

One interesting [Question]: Why mid = head + (tail - head) / 2 rather than mid = (head + tail) / 2 ?

_Answer :_

This is a famous bug in binary search. if the size of array are too large, equal or larger than the upper bound of int type, hi + lo may cause an overflow and become a negative number. It's ok to write (hi + lo) / 2 here, leetcode will not give you a very large array to test. But we'd better know this. For a detailed information or history of this bug, you could search "binary search bug" on google.
