#### Problem Link:[Factorial Trailing Zeroes ](https://leetcode.com/problems/factorial-trailing-zeroes/) 

#### Solution 1 

##### Idea:

The key is to find out the number of factor 5 in n!. Because trailing zeroes are composed by 2s and 5s. And the number of factor 2 is always more than factor 5. Thus, as long as we know the number of factor 5 in n!, we know the number of trailing zeroes.

##### Time Complexity:

O(log(n))

##### Space Complexity:

O(1)

##### Source code:
{% highlight C++ %}

class Solution {
public:
    int trailingZeroes(int n) {
        int ans = 0;
        while (n){
            n /= 5;
            ans += n;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};

{% endhighlight %}
