### Problem Link:[Linked List Cycle II](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/) 

### Solution 1 Two Points

#### Idea:

Use two points `p` and `q`.    
`p` move forward by one step every time and `q` move forward by two steps every time.    
If there exists a cycle, these two points will meet each other.   
When they meet, continue to move `p` to calculate the length of cycle `n`.    
Then, put two points back to the head.      
First, move `p` forward by `n` step.    
Second, move `p` and `q` at the same time. They will meet at the beginning of cycle.

#### Time Complexity:

O(n)

#### Space Complexity:

O(1)
