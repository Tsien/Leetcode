#### Problem Link:[Distinct Subsequences ](https://leetcode.com/problems/distinct-subsequences/) 

#### Solution 1 DP

##### Idea:

keep a table of two strings. 

`table[i][j]` means the number of distinct subsequences of `T[0...i]` in `S[0...j]`.  

Status transform formula: `table[i][j] = table[i][j - 1] + (t[i] == s[j] ? table[i - 1][j - 1] : 0)`

If `S[j + 1] != t[i]`, we have to delete it. Thus, `table[i][j] = table[i][j - 1]`.

If not, we have two choices, either delete it or retain it. Thus, `table[i][j] = table[i][j - 1] + table[i - 1][j - 1]`


E.g., `S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"`     



 0  |  r  |  a  |  b  |  b  |  b  |  i  |  t       
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---      
 r  |  1  |  1  |  1  |  1  |  1  |  1  |  1        
 a  |     |  1  |  1  |  1  |  1  |  1  |  1       
 b  |     |     |  1  |  2  |  3  |  3  |  3       
 b  |     |     |     |  1  |  3  |  3  |  3        
 i  |     |     |     |     |  0  |  3  |  3      
 t  |     |     |     |     |     |  0  |  3       

So the answer is `table[5][6] = 3`.
   
##### Time Complexity:

O(n * m), n = length of s, m = length of t

##### Space Complexity:

O(n)

##### Source code:
{% highlight C++ %}

class Solution {
public:
    int numDistinct(string s, string t) {
        int n = s.length();
        vector<int> pre(n + 1, 1), cur(n + 1, 0);
        for (auto i : t){
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
                cur[j + 1] = cur[j] + (s[j] == i ? pre[j] : 0);
            pre = cur;
        }
        return cur[n];
    }
