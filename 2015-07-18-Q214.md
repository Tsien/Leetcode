#### Problem Link:[Shortest Palindrome ](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-palindrome/) 

#### Solution 1 A straightforward method

##### Idea:

Search by starting from the ideal point which is the middle of original string.     
`head = mid - 1, tail = mid or mid + 1 // depend on whether the length of string is odd or even`      
try to find the shortest Palindrome by these two pointers.     

* If the original string is Palindrome, then just return itself.       
* If not, then check where these two pointers stuck.     
    * If `head < 0`, it means `s[0...tail - 1]` is Palindrome. Thus, add the reverse string of `s[tail...]` to the front and return the result.        
    * If not, continue to reduce head but fix tail until we find `s[head] == s[tail]`.       
        * Now, if `head < 0`, it means we need add the reverse of `s[tail...]` to the front in order to getting a Palindrome. Besides, we need to get the shortest Palindrome of `s[0...tail - 1]` recursively. Don't forget the remaining part. At last, combine those three parts and return the result.       
        * If not, check whether the inner part is Palindrome.    
            * If yes, continue to check the outer part recursively.     
            * If not, start over from where two pointers stuck.
