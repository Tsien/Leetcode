### Problem Link:[Search in Rotated Sorted Array II](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/) 

### Solution 1 Loop

#### Idea:
Same as Q33. 

This lazy method still works and duplicates do not affect the time complexity.

#### Time Complexity:
O(n)

#### Space Complexity:
O(1)

#### Source code:
{% highlight C++ %}

class Solution {
public:
    bool search(int A[], int n, int target) {
        if (A[n - 1] >= target){
            for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--){
                if (A[i] == target)
                    return true;
                if (i > 0 && A[i] < A[i - 1])
                    return false;
            }
        }
        else{
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
                if (A[i] == target)
                    return true;
                if (i + 1 < n && A[i] > A[i + 1])
                    return false;
            }            
        }
        return false;
    }
};

### Solution 2 Binary Search

#### Idea:

Same as Q33. The following line will take care of duplicates.

    while (head < mid && nums[mid] == nums[head]){head++;}

The time complexity might be increased, but still around O(log(n)). 

Perform binary search by using two points, one from the head and another from the tail. 

    mid = (head + tail) / 2;

As mentioned in Solution 1, there are two parts in a rotated array. Therefore, 

First, figure out which part the nums[mid] exists in.

Then, decide how to move two points.

Typically, the former part is greater than the latter one. So,

    if nums[mid] >= nums[head], it means nums[mid] exists in the former part.
    otherwise, it exists in the latter one.
    
when nums[mid] exists in the former part, 

    if nums[mid] > target and nums[head] <= target, then we can locate target in the range of [head, mid - 1], so move tail to mid - 1. 
    otherwise, move head to mid + 1.

when nums[mid] exists in the latter part,
    
    if nums[mid] < target and nums[tail] >= target, then we can locate target in the range of [mid + 1, tail], so move head to mid + 1.
    otherwise, move tail to mid - 1.


**Pay attention to corner case :**
    
    Input:	[1,3,1,1,1], 3


#### Time Complexity:

O(log(n))

#### Space Complexity:
O(1)
