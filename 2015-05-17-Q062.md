### Problem Link:[Unique Paths ](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/) 

### Solution 1 A normal method

#### Idea:

In a m * n grid, the robot has N = m + n - 2 choices. Either go right or go down. 

So, there are $$$ {n \choose k} $$$ unique paths. This result could be obtained by iteration.

Pay attention to overflow. 

#### Time Complexity:
O(min(m, n))

#### Space Complexity:
O(1)

#### Source code:
{% highlight C++ %}

class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        if (m > n)// reduce calculation
            swap(m, n);
        int64_t pre = 1, N = n + m - 2;//m * n grid, the robot has N = m + n - 2 choices.
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++)//
            pre = pre * (N - i + 1) / i;
        return pre;
    }
};

### Solution 2 DP

#### Idea:

    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1];

dp[i][j] equals to the number of all unique paths from [1,1] to [i,j]

#### Time Complexity:

O(n * m)

#### Space Complexity:

O(n * m)

#### Source code:

{% highlight C++ %}

class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));
        dp[0][1] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++)
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++)
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1];
        return dp[m][n];
    }
};
