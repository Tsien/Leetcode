#### Problem Link:[Candy ](https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/) 

#### Solution 1 Iterative 

##### Idea:

3 situations: increasing serial, decreasing serial and constant serial. 

In fact, increasing and decreasing serial are the same. For example, [1,2,3,4] obtains candies [1,2,3,4] and [4,3,2,1] obtains candies [4,3,2,1]. But we should obey the rule that higher score obtains more candy. So pay attention to the catenation of increasing and decreasing serial. For example, [1,2,6,4,3,2,1] should obtain candies [1,2,5,4,3,2,1]. 

As for constant serial, just allocate one candy for them except the beginning one. 

##### Time Complexity:

O(n)

##### Space Complexity:

O(1)

class Solution {
public:
    int candy(vector<int>& ratings) {
        int n = ratings.size(), i = 1, ans = 0, inc = 1, dec = 1;
        ratings.insert(ratings.begin(), INT_MIN);
        while (i <= n){
            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]){
                if (i > 1 && ratings[i - 1] <= ratings[i - 2]){
                    ans += inc <= dec ? (dec - inc + 1) : 0;
                    inc = 2;
                    dec = 0;
                }
                ans += inc;
                inc++;
            }
            else if (ratings[i] < ratings[i - 1]){
                if (i > 1 && ratings[i - 1] > ratings[i - 2])
                    dec = 1;
                else if (i > 1 && ratings[i - 1] == ratings[i - 2]){
                    dec = 2;
                    inc = INT_MAX;
                }
                ans += dec;
                dec++;
            }
            else 
                ans++;
            i++;
        }
        return ans + (inc <= dec ? (dec - inc + 1) : 0);
    }
