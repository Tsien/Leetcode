## [Container With Most Water ](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/) 

### Solution 1

#### Idea:
This question means to require us choose two heights which make the max area with X-axis. It seems like there are $$${n \choose 2}$$$ combinations. However, if we look the Container from the top, we can find that there are actually less number of containers with different area. So, we just traverse those different containers and find the container with max area.

Use two points. The height of container depends on the lower bar, so every time move the lower bar. This means go up to a higher level. In this way, we can traverse all possible sizes of containers.

#### Time Complexity:
O(n)

#### Space Complexity:
O(1)

#### Source code:
{% highlight C++ %}

    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int tmp, maxA = 0, low = 0, high = height.size() - 1;
        while (low < high){
            if (height[low] < height[high]){
                tmp = height[low] * (high - low);
                low++;
            }
            else{
                tmp = height[high] * (high - low);
                high--;
            }
            maxA = max(tmp, maxA);
        }
        return maxA;
    }
