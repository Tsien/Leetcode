### Problem Link:[Trapping Rain Water ](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/) 

### Solution 1 Two Points

#### Idea:

The core thought is to calculate the whole area and then subtract the blocks.

Use two points. One from the head, another from the tail. 

#### Time Complexity:
O(n)

#### Space Complexity:
O(1)

#### Source code:
{% highlight C++ %}

class Solution {
public:
    int trap(vector<int>& height) {
        int tmp, level = 0, left = 0, right = height.size() - 1, sum = 0, block = 0;
        while (left <= right){
            tmp = min(height[left], height[right]);//decide the lower bar
            if (tmp > level){//record the current level
                sum += (tmp - level) * (right - left + 1);//count areas
                level = tmp;//update the level.
            }
            block += tmp;//count blocks.
            height[left] < height[right] ? left++ : right--;
        }
        return sum - block;
    }
};
