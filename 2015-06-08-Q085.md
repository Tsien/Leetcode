### Problem Link:[Maximal Rectangle ](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-rectangle/) 

### Solution 1 DP

#### Idea:

It's easy to think of DP method.   
We need a vector to record the height of elements in every row. The height means the number of continuous '1'. Obviously, we only need the previous row's height to compute the current row's height. So the space complexity is O(n).    
If we know the height, we move back to find the max matrix. In order to keep this matrix integrate, i.e., composed by all '1', we need to record the minimum height.   
Check the code for more details.


#### Time Complexity:
O(m * n^2)   
Here, m = # row of matrix, n = # column of matrix

#### Space Complexity:
O(n)

class Solution {
public:
    int maximalRectangle(vector<vector<char>>& matrix) {
        if (matrix.empty()) return 0;
        int m = matrix.size(), n = matrix[0].size();
        vector<int> dp(n + 1, 0), tmp(n + 1, 0);
        int area = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++){
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++){
                if (matrix[i][j] == '0')
                    dp[j + 1] = 0;
                else{
                    dp[j + 1] = tmp[j + 1] + 1;
                    int k = j, minH = INT_MAX;
                    while (k >= 0 && matrix[i][k] == '1'){//move back
                        minH = min(minH, dp[k + 1]);//update minimum height.
                        area = max(area, minH * (j - k + 1));
                        k--;
                    }
                }
