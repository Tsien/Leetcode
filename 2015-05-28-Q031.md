### Problem Link:[Next Permutation ](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-permutation/) 

### Solution 1 Stack

#### Idea:

First, find the element that needs to be swapped. Scan from the end of array, when we encounter an element which is smaller than its precursor, then we know it needs to be swapped with the first bigger element in the scanned elements set.     
If the array is already in descending order, i.e., there is no element that needs to be swapped. So just sort the array.  

#### Time Complexity:
O(nlog(n))

#### Space Complexity:
O(1)

#### Source code:
{% highlight C++ %}

class Solution {
public:
    void nextPermutation(vector<int>& nums) {
        int i = nums.size() - 1;
        while (i > 0 && nums[i - 1] >= nums[i]){i--;}//find the element needs to be swapped.
        if (i) {
            for (int j = nums.size() - 1; j >= i; j--)
                if (nums[j] > nums[i - 1]){//find the first bigger element
                    swap(nums[j], nums[i - 1]);
                    break;
                }
        }
        sort(nums.begin() + i, nums.end());
    }
};
