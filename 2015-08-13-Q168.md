#### Problem Link:[Excel Sheet Column Title ](https://leetcode.com/problems/excel-sheet-column-title/) 

#### Solution 1 

##### Idea:

This problem is equal to convert a number from its decimal format to its 26-bits format. 

For example: n = 12;

1. calculate `n mod 2 = 0`.
2. add 0 to the head of answer.
3. calculate `n = n / 2 `
4. repeat 1~3 until n = 0

We will get `1100` at last.

Similarly, there are 26 characters. Like one bit represents two status. Here, in Excel Sheet Column Title, one character could represent 26 status.

The above algorithm still works, if we just alternative 2 with 26 and pay attention to the zero remains.  


##### Time Complexity:

class Solution {
public:
    string convertToTitle(int n) {
        string code = "ZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXY", res;
        int tmp;
        while (n > 0){
            tmp = n % 26;
            res = code[tmp] + res;
            if (tmp == 0)
                n--;
            n /= 26;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
