### Problem Link:[Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/) 

### Solution 1 A lazy method

#### Idea:

    If the array is rotated, then there are two ascending parts. Just find the first decreasing element.
    If the array isn't rotated, then return the first element.

#### Time Complexity:
O(n)

#### Space Complexity:
O(1)

#### Source code:
{% highlight C++ %}

class Solution {
public:
    int findMin(vector<int> &num) {
        for (int i = 1; i < num.size(); i++){
            if (num[i] < num[i - 1])
                return num[i];
        }
        return num[0];
    }
};

### Solution 2 Binary Search

#### Idea:

Similar to Q33 and Q 81.

There are two situations:

    If nums[mid] > nums[tail], it means a rotated array. The Minimum located in the range of (mid, tail]. So, move head to mid + 1.
    Otherwise, the Minimum exists in [head, mid]. So, move tail to mid.

Tips:

* We'd better compare nums[mid] with nums[tail] instead of nums[head]. 



#### Time Complexity:

O(log(n))

#### Space Complexity:

O(1)

#### Source code:

{% highlight C++ %}

class Solution {
public:
    int findMin(vector<int>& nums) {
        int head, tail, mid;
        head = 0;
        tail = nums.size() - 1;
        while (head < tail){
            mid = head + (tail - head) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] > nums[tail])//means a rotated array.
                head = mid + 1;//nums[mid] isn't the minimum
            else 
                tail = mid;//nums[mid] is possible minimum
        }
        return nums[head];
    }
};
